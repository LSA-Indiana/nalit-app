# NALIT Conference Web App

The NALIT app is a mobile web app built for the NALIT Conference. This app uses the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) and Angular 1.

To start, run through the setup information located in the [Ionic Framework documentation](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/).

Then, clone the app and run ```npm install``` in the nalit directory.

Once the modules are installed, run ```ionic serve``` to start the project in a web browser.
